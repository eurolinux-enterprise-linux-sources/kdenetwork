This file contains some TODO items for the identity refactory being done on 
kopete:

- Make all Kopete::Account reimplementations read info from the identity. It
  should still be discussed what will be the approach for synchronization   with 
  server-side information.

- The accounts might be able to write identity properties when the identity has
  only one account assigned to it.

- Remove all protocol-specific user info dialogs, and keep only dialogs to show
  contact's info (and those should probably be set as read-only even if the
  protocol supports writing contact's info to make this simpler. 

- Handle status changes and port the identity stuff to the new status manager
  implementation.

- Properly handle identity's property changes in the Kopete::Account derived classes

X Merge the account config and identity config dialogs into a single dialog (as
  suggested and started to be implemented by Gof).

X Evaluate alternatives to the text links on the identity widget (as suggested by
  Bille)

X Try to figure out the slow down seen by Gof on the identity widget (from the logs
  it seems something related to FileEngine, but not sure)

- Check if there is something interesting on
  http://www.pidgin.im/~seanegan/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/identity.html

X Make the identity widget a bit smaller (as suggested by Matt)
